A portfolio? A blog? A website? I don't know.

## Built on Next.js. Deployed on Vercel. Content managed from graphCMS.

The idea was simple. Quickly prototype a place for all of my stuff. I love Next.js and I wanted to play more with SSR.
Naturally, Vercel was the choice for an easy deployment. I don't need anything crazy. After all, this is my personal site. Vercel is more than capable.
And finally, I wanted the power of graphQL and an easy way to manage content, so graphCMS was a perfect fit.
